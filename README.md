## File Structure

`src/assets` is the place having the avatar images.

`src/components` is for the components that are generically useful.

`src/mobx` is for the MobX state management library. It has the application state, and can be managed by any React Components in the whole application. 

`src/routes` is the folder which can help us render different screens. For now, the components inside it are just rendering other components, but can be used when expanding the application.

`src/utils` is a folder that has utility functions. Here, we are using few utility functions for date operations.
